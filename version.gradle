/**
 * This file exposes a version string which uses the github repo as a source of truth.
 *
 * By convention this expects that:
 * * there's a master branch that will contain releases
 * * there will be feature branches branched out of master
 * * each named version has a corresponding tag that leads to the releases' source code.
 * * tags follow a pattern and contain a version string: e.g. v0.0.1 v10.0.0 v4.6.8-qa
 * * version strings follow semver: 0.0.1 10.0.0 4.6.8-qa
 * * `-dirty` suffix is reserved for taging non-committed changes: there are no tags with `-dirty` suffix
 * * Other manual or automated process creates the tag/release externally.
 *
 * The intention of this script is to make possible that:
 * * From a version string we can trace back to a commit in this git repo
 * * From a glance we can take a non-release artifact and relate it to its closest release
 * * Prevent non-reproducible artifacts to look like releases.
 *
 *
 * The lifecycle of a change looks like:
 * * 0.0.1 is tagged as v0.0.1 in commit in master
 * * 0.0.1 may appear later in a newly created branch which hasnt made any commits (since it shares the same commit w/ master)
 * * 0.0.1-dirty appears when changes are written locally but not yet commited
 * * 0.0.1-c31368ccd appears when a new commit is added to the feature branch
 * * 0.0.2 is created later by externally creating tag 0.0.2 after the feature branch is committed to master
 *
 * * Likewise for a hypothetical version 0.0.1-qa:
 * * 0.0.1-qa is tagged as v0.0.1-q in commit in master
 * * 0.0.1-qa may appear later in a newly created branch which hasnt made any commits (since it shares the same commit w/ master)
 * * 0.0.1-qa-dirty appears when changes are written locally but not yet commited
 * * 0.0.1-qa-c31368ccd appears when a new commit is added to the feature branch
 * * 0.0.2-qa is created later by externally creating tag 0.0.2-qa after the feature branch is committed to the base branch (qa most likely)
 *
 * TODO: move this to some library that can be easily import from somewhere else.
